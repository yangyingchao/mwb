* Introduction

MWB stands for "MetaWeblog", it is an submode for org mode and can be used to
publish org files to meta web blog.

It is based on [[http://www.cnblogs.com/Open_Source/archive/2012/09/14/2684897.html][CnBlog]], and was modified to port to other meta web blogs.

* Usage

Download this package from [[https://github.com/yangyingchao/mwb][github]] and put into PATH , then add
following codes to your init file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path PATH)
  (autoload 'mwb-minor-mode "mwb" "mwb minor mode" t)
  (autoload 'mwb-new-post "mwb" "new post" t)
#+END_SRC

If you want to turn on mwb-minor-mode automatically for some mode (org-mode,
for example), you can add following line:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-mode-hook 'mwb-minor-mode)
#+END_SRC


Then, open an org file, and stroke: M-x: mwb-setup-blog, and follow the
instructions.

 When finished setting up, edit an org file, and stroke: M-x: mwb-new-post,
 and then waits for the post to be done.

 That's all.
